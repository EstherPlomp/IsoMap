# IsoMap
Data and script to generate a map of the Netherlands for isotopic analyses (strontium isotopes)

# Motivation
Most maps generated in the current literature are creating using ArcGIS. The reproducibility of these maps can be improved by using open source software, such as R, and sharing the data and script so that others can review and reuse the data/code. 

# Installation
These scripts were generated in R and RStudio (Version 1.2.5019). Required packages: sp, raster, rworldmap, RColorBrewer
Installation of the packages and loading the data should only take several minutes. 

# How to use
You can run each script separately with the data provided, or use your own dataset.
